# Think Bayes notes
This repository contains some notes I made for the book Think Bayes by Allen Downey.

These notes generally follow the examples from the book quite closely, but deviate in places. The book is freely available [here](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/). You can find the code repository for the book [here](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes).
